 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
To set timelines and milestones for task completion, I will first need to organize similar user stories into cohesive groups. By grouping related user stories together, I can then estimate the time required to complete each group of features. This will help in setting realistic timelines and milestones for task completion.

Once the user stories are grouped, I can work with the development team to estimate the effort required for each group of features. Based on these estimates, I can then create a timeline that outlines when each group of features is expected to be completed. Milestones can be set at key points in the project timeline to track progress and ensure that the project is on track for completion.

By organizing user stories into cohesive groups and estimating the effort required for each group, I can effectively set timelines and milestones for task completion in the product development process.
